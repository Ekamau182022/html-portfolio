<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m just beginning my journey into web development and excited to explore how websites and applications are built from the ground up. Although I don’t have much coding experience yet, I’m eager to learn the core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What drew me to this course is the idea of being able to create something useful, interactive, and visually appealing that others can access and use online. I enjoy solving problems and learning how things work, so I see web development as a great opportunity to build practical skills while also being creative.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m focused on understanding the basics and getting comfortable with the tools and languages developers use. I know it will take time and practice, but I’m motivated to improve each day. My goal is to eventually build websites or applications that not only look good but also function well and are accessible to everyone. I’m looking forward to learning from this course and connecting with others who are on a similar path.</p>
